## Summary:

As the first post on this blog, the motivation behind it and the content that will be discussed in it are explained.

## This is Where it Starts:

Welcome! So here it is, my first post. As such, I would like to why I started this blog, and what exactly I will write about in it.

There are three reasons why I wanted to make a blog, namely:

1. Contribute to the software community.
2. Learn by "teaching" and repetition.
3. Serve as a reminder, primarily for myself.

I will try to make all posts well structured, short, and concise, so that they can be read in the least amount of time. The posts will be split into (mainly) two categories: software development problems I have faced and their solutions, and software engineering research that I find interesting or immediately applicable to industry. Each post will be appropriately tagged (personal experience, research, etc.).

The frequency of the posts will depend on how busy I am (and if there is any content), but I will try to post at least once every two weeks. I am also planning on translating all posts in Japanese, if I have enough free time. I hope you, the reader, can find something of a value within my posts.

**Let's start!**
